# The Axe-Change Archive

A copy of everything that's been uploaded to http://axechange.fractalaudio.com/

This probably isn't totally kosher but I worry this archive of settings will go away.

There's a downloader in the `./bin/` directory that will pull down new things since it was last run. It keeps an index that was last seen in the `config.yaml` file in the root of the repository. If you remove it, it downloads things from 0001 again.
